Hi!

My name is David (Ahmadreza) Mosallanezhad. I got my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from Shiraz University under supervision of [Prof. Ali Hamzeh](http://shirazu.ac.ir/faculty/home/ali/en). Currently, I am a first year PhD student at Arizona State University. My research interest mainly lies within machine learning algorithms and applications. Currently, Iâ€™m working on several Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning projects.

My resume is available [here](https://davood-m.github.io/files/resume.pdf) (updated on 10/11/2019)
