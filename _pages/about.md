Hi!

My name is David (Ahmadreza) Mosallanezhad. I got my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from Shiraz University under supervision of [Prof. Ali Hamzeh](http://shirazu.ac.ir/faculty/home/ali/en). Currently, I am a third year PhD student at Arizona State University working at the [DMML lab](http://dmml.asu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/). My research interest mainly lies within privacy and fairness in machine learning and natural language processing algorithms/applications. I'm currently working on AI deferral projects at [DHS-CAOE](https://caoe.asu.edu/) under supervisions of [Dr. Michelle Mancenido](https://newcollege.asu.edu/michelle-mancenido).

My resume is available [here](https://davood-m.github.io/files/resume.pdf) (updated on 12/11/2020)
