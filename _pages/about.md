Hi!

My name is David (Ahmadreza) Mosallanezhad. I got my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from Shiraz University under supervision of [Prof. Ali Hamzeh](http://shirazu.ac.ir/faculty/home/ali/en). Currently, I am a second year PhD student at Arizona State University working at the [DMML lab](http://dmml.asu.edu/) under supervisions of [Prof. Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) and [Dr. Mickey Mancenido](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickey-mancenido-879b11a). My research interest mainly lies within machine learning and natural language processing algorithms and applications.

My resume is available [here](https://davood-m.github.io/files/resume.pdf) (updated on 8/27/2020)
